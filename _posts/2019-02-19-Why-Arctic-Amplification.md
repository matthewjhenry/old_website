<p>The Earth's surface is warming 2-3x faster in the Arctic than the global average. There are many different reasons for this extra warming at the poles. However, there is still debate on which is the dominant mechanism.</p>

<p>The figure above is from <a href='http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/cdeser/docs/submitted.smith.pamip.mar18.pdf'>Smith et al. (2018)</a> and shows the <i>pattern</i> of surface warming in projections of future climate change. The land warms faster than the ocean and the Arctic region warms from 2 to 4 times faster than the global mean (see zonal average plot on the right). </p>

<p>What are the possible reasons for this amplified warming?</p>

<p>We will go through the four main reasons given in the literature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surface albedo feedback</li>
<li>Atmospheric energy transport</li>
<li>Planck feedback</li>
<li>Lapse Rate feedback</li>
</ul>

<p>But, first, we look at how each mechanism contributes to polar amplification in comprehensive climate models.</p>

<p>Using <a href='https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/radiative-kernels-climate-models'>radiative kernels</a>, <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2071'>Pithan and Mauritsen (2014)</a> decomposed the pattern of warming into contributions from the different forcings and feedbacks. The figure above shows how much each forcing (CO2) and feedback (everything else) contribute to tropical warming (x-axis) and Arctic warming (y-axis). The albedo, for example, is a feedback that only affects the high latitudes, hence contributes to no tropical warming (0 on x-axis) but does contribute to Arctic warming (around 3.3K). The distance from the gray dashed one-to-one line indicates whether the forcing/feedback contributes to Arctic or tropical amplification.</p>

<p>We now describe the mechanisms behind the four feedbacks contributing to Arctic amplification.</p>

<h2>Sea ice albedo feedback</h2>

<p>This figure from <a href='https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/12277'>NASA</a> shows the 2016 Arctic sea ice minimum (911,000 square miles) and the 1981-2010 average (gold line). This decrease in sea ice extent means the highly reflective white surface is replaced with the far less reflective ocean, which absorbs more sunlight than the ice surface and induces additional local warming.</p>
