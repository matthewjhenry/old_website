<p>The Earth's surface is warming 2-3x faster in the Arctic than the global average. There are many different reasons for this extra warming at the poles. However, there is still debate on which is the dominant mechanism.</p>

<p>The bottom panels show time series of sea-ice fraction, sea-ice thickness and of surface temperatures over the three surfaces. Temperatures over ice and over land warm rapidly, while the ocean warms more slowly. The same plot for the HadGEM2-CC model gives a similar picture, though the ocean warms more quickly:</p>
