title: "What causes the arctic amplification of surface warming?"

<p>The Earth's surface is warming 2-3x faster in the Arctic than the global average. There are many different reasons for this extra warming at the poles. However, there is still debate on which is the dominant mechanism.</p>

<p>The figure above is from <a href='http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/cdeser/docs/submitted.smith.pamip.mar18.pdf'>Smith et al. (2018)</a> and shows the <i>pattern</i> of surface warming in projections of future climate change. The land warms faster than the ocean and the Arctic region warms from 2 to 4 times faster than the global mean (see zonal average plot on the right). </p>

<p>What are the possible reasons for this amplified warming?</p>

<p>We will go through the four main reasons given in the literature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surface albedo feedback</li>
<li>Planck feedback</li>
<li>Lapse Rate feedback</li>
<li>Atmospheric energy transport</li>
</ul>

<p>But, first, we look at how each mechanism contributes to polar amplification in comprehensive climate models. Using <a href='https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/radiative-kernels-climate-models'>radiative kernels</a>, <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2071'>Pithan and Mauritsen (2014)</a> decomposed the pattern of warming into contributions from the different forcings and feedbacks.</p>
