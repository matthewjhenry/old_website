<p>I remember first learning about positive feedbacks in a misleading way, such as in this figure from the <a href='https://nas-sites.org/americasclimatechoices/more-resources-on-climate-change/climate-change-lines-of-evidence-booklet/evidence-impacts-and-choices-figure-gallery/figure-9/'>National Academies of Science</a>.</p>

<p>This kind of representation makes it seem positive feedbacks lead to runaway climate change: the warming from increasing greenhouse gases leads to sea ice melt, which leads to more warming, which leads to more ice melt and so on.</p>

<p>However, none of the IPCC models have runaway climate change. As is shown in this figure from ..., all seem to equilibrate once we reach net zero emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>This is caused by the main negative feedback: the temperature feedback.</p>

<h3>Why does the surface and troposphere warm when greenhouse gases increase?</h3>

<p>The absorbed solar radiation needs to be in balance with the outgoing longwave radiation emitted by the earth. The addition of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reflects part of the heat emitted by the surface back to the surface and hence reduces the outgoing longwave radiation: this causes an imbalance as there is more absorbed solar radiation than outgoing longwave radiation. The response of the surface and troposphere is to heat up to increase outgoing longwave radiation and restore balance.</p>
